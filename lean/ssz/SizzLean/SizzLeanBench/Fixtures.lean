# `SizzLeanBench.Fixtures` — shared bench fixtures

Four SSZ-shaped structures used as the workload payloads
across every scenario in the bench. All `deriving SSZRepr` so
the exact same user code goes through them. They form a
fixture-size ladder so a single scenario shape can be measured
at four points along the tree-depth / payload-size axis.

## `ValidatorShape`

Mirrors the consensus-spec `Validator` layout (no LeanEthCS
dependency): 8 fixed-size fields, ~144 bytes serialised, depth
4. The smallest fixture — exercises the cache's per-operation
constant-cost path. Wrapper overhead is visible here; payback
from the cache is *not*.

## `ValidatorSet16`

Wraps a `Vector ValidatorShape 16` — 16 nested containers,
~2.3 KB serialised, depth 8. The small "wide" fixture — the
cache wins start to show because every operation walks more
nodes.

## `ValidatorSet256` *(large)*

Wraps a `Vector ValidatorShape 256` — 256 nested containers,
~36 KB serialised, depth 12. The intermediate-scale fixture —
where the cache's spine-walking advantage starts to dominate
and where the planned SIMD batched SHA-256 path will become
visible (each cold root pays ~4 K pair hashes; AVX-512 fills
its 16-pipe lane on this size).

## `ValidatorSet4096` *(huge)*

Wraps a `Vector ValidatorShape 4096` — 4096 nested containers,
~580 KB serialised, depth 16. The mainnet-shape fixture (still
4× below 1M-validator mainnet, but at the same order of
magnitude). Used in the deepest cold-root row to confirm
scaling and to provide a hard upper bound on per-call costs.

## Salting

Every fixture takes a `UInt8` salt parameter; the salt bytes
flow into the fields so consecutive calls with different salts
produce structurally-distinct values. This defeats Lean's
constant-folding on top-level constant values, which would
otherwise make the bench timings meaningless (the runtime
would memoise the result of one call and return it for all
subsequent calls).

walks ~12 tree levels (set/root-fill) or skips ~4 K already-

will have the most amortised work to act on. -/

a chain of `IO.Ref.modify` calls that fold the bytes into a
