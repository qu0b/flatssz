# `SizzLeanBench.ProfileMain` — `ssz_profile` exe driver

Standalone driver for the S10 cached-path phase profile.
Invoked as

```
lake exe ssz_profile > packages/SizzLean/bench/profile-<timestamp>.tsv
```

Emits the same TSV shape as `ssz_bench` so the same diff /
inspect tooling works. Kept as a separate exe because profiling
runs are ad-hoc (run once, read the breakdown, act on it) and
shouldn't bloat the regular bench wall-clock.
