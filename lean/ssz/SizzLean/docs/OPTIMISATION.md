# SizzLean — Cache & performance architecture

This document is the implementation-level companion to
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §6 and the design-research
notes in [`research/cache-research.md`](research/cache-research.md).
ARCHITECTURE.md states *what* the cache layer is and *why* it
exists; this document explains *how* the current code is
organised (Phase 14, shipped) and *what the open Stage 17
sub-stages would actually do* (more detail than PLAN.md carries).

Pointers to prior art live throughout — most importantly
[`protolambda/remerkleable`](https://github.com/protolambda/remerkleable),
the Python persistent-Merkle-tree library whose `PairNode` /
`RootNode` design SizzLean inherits, and Lighthouse / Lodestar /
Teku for the optimisation patterns that production clients
converged on.

## Scope

The library's central correctness path is the verified spec
recursion on `SSZType` (Layer 1). It is *complete on its own* —
`SSZ.hashTreeRoot Sha256 v` on a plain `T` reads a 32-byte root
out without ever touching this document's machinery.

What the cache layer adds is *production performance*: a
hash-tree root after a single-field mutation should walk
`O(depth)` nodes (40-ish SHA-256 calls for `BeaconState`),
not the whole tree (millions of leaves). The Layer 4 cache is
therefore a *performance layer*, not a verification layer —
asserted equivalent to the spec, validated empirically against
`ethereum/consensus-spec-tests` plus the in-library
`SizzLeanTests/TreeBackedCoherence.lean` property test. None of
this document's contents enters the proof obligation; none of
its optimisations changes what `rfl` / `decide` close on the
plain-`T` / `SSZ.PureBox` paths.

## Phase 14 — what's implemented

Stages 12, 13, 14a–e shipped. The end-to-end story is:

* SSZ values live in a persistent binary Merkle tree (`Node`)
  alongside a value-level `view : T`.
* Each interior node carries an optional cached root, filled
  lazily on first walk.
* Updates allocate one fresh `pair` per level along the path
  from the changed leaf to the root; everything off-path stays
  shared by reference (Lean 4's reference-counted runtime does
  the work without explicit `Arc`).
* The cached root is cleared (set to `none`) along the updated
  spine; the next root read re-fills it walking only the dirty
  spine.

This section walks the implementation file by file.

### `Node` representation

`packages/SizzLean/SizzLean/Cache/MerkleTree/Node.lean`.

```lean
inductive Node where
  | leaf : ByteArray → Node
  | pair : Node → Node → Option ByteArray → Node
  deriving Inhabited
```

Two constructors:

* `leaf b` — a 32-byte leaf. The leaf bytes *are* its root.
* `pair l r c` — an interior node. `c : Option ByteArray` is the
  cached root: `some r` after `merkleRootWithCache` has walked
  this subtree, `none` after the most recent `setAt` cleared the
  cache along the updated spine.

This mirrors `remerkleable`'s `PairNode(left, right, root :
Optional[Root])` and `RootNode(root)` precisely — with the
single departure that we lift `RootNode` to be `leaf` (always-
populated 32 bytes), and represent "depth-`d` empty subtree" as
`zeroLeaf H d` (= `leaf ZERO_HASHES[d]`), not as a separate
constructor. The two-constructor model keeps the inductive small
enough that `Node.cached`, `merkleRootWithCache`, and `setAt`
each pattern-match on three or four cases, which the kernel
unfolds cleanly during the property tests in
`SizzLeanTests/SetAtRandom.lean`.

The `Option ByteArray` cache slot is *morally const* mutation:
filling `none → some r` doesn't change the logical value
(`merkleRoot` is a pure function of `(left, right)`), only the
observation cost. `remerkleable` calls this "lazy root caching";
Lighthouse's Milhouse and ChainSafe's persistent-merkle-tree do
the same in mutable form. In Lean the slot is an inductive field
that an update writes to a fresh `pair` cell — same observable
semantics, different memory model.

### `ZERO_HASHES` precomputation

`packages/SizzLean/SizzLean/Cache/MerkleTree/Zero.lean`.

A length-65 vector indexed by depth `d ∈ [0, 64]`:

```lean
def ZERO_HASHES (H : Type) [Hasher H] : Vector ByteArray 65
```

The recurrence is `ZERO_HASHES[0] = 32 zero bytes` and
`ZERO_HASHES[d + 1] = Hasher.combine ZERO_HASHES[d]
ZERO_HASHES[d]`. The cap of 64 covers every SSZ tree depth that
appears through Gloas (`BeaconState.validators` is `List
Validator (2 ^ 40)` — depth 40 + 1 for the length mix-in).

The single most-important property this buys: a `List[Validator,
2 ^ 40]` with 1M populated entries — typical mainnet — is
representable in O(populated × depth) Node allocations *plus
constant zero-subtree pointers*. Every unpopulated subtree is a
single `zeroLeaf H d` allocation reusing the precomputed bytes.
Without this, the tree representation would have to materialise
2^40 leaves; with it, the unpopulated subtree's "leaf-ness" is
inherited from a precomputed digest.

`zeroLeaf` and `Node.ofLeaves` are the two consumers; both are
purely structural and recurse on the leaf array's length.

### Cached root computation (`merkleRootWithCache`)

`packages/SizzLean/SizzLean/Cache/MerkleTree/Merkle.lean`.

```lean
def Node.merkleRootWithCache (H : Type) [Hasher H] :
    Node → ByteArray × Node
  | .leaf b => (b, .leaf b)
  | .pair l r (some root) => (root, .pair l r (some root))
  | .pair l r none =>
      let (rootL, l') := Node.merkleRootWithCache H l
      let (rootR, r') := Node.merkleRootWithCache H r
      let root := Hasher.combine (H := H) rootL rootR
      (root, .pair l' r' (some root))
```

Three arms:

* `leaf b` — root is `b`, return the node unchanged.
* `pair _ _ (some r)` — **cache hit**; return the cached root,
  return the node unchanged. This is the line that makes
  Lighthouse's "BeaconState root in 9 ms after a single
  validator update" performance achievable.
* `pair l r none` — **cache miss**; recurse both children, combine
  their roots via the chosen `Hasher H` instance, return a fresh
  `pair` with the freshly cached root. The fresh-pair allocation
  is unavoidable in the immutable representation — but it's only
  along the dirty spine, never the off-spine subtrees, which the
  caller passed in by reference and the recursion returns by
  reference.

`Node.merkleRoot H n := (n.merkleRootWithCache H).1` is the
convenience wrapper that drops the cache-filled `Node` when the
caller wants only the digest.

The cache hit on `pair _ _ (some r)` is what makes the
optimisation worthwhile. Without it, every root computation
would re-walk the whole tree; with it, only dirty subtrees walk.
After a single-field update, only `depth` nodes are dirty along
the spine; the other `2^depth − depth` subtrees serve their
cached root in O(1).

### Structural-sharing updates (`setAt` / `setManyAt`)

`packages/SizzLean/SizzLean/Cache/MerkleTree/SetAt.lean`.

Updates walk the tree by *generalised index* (gindex) — the
standard SSZ scheme that addresses any tree position by the
binary representation of its level-by-level path.

```lean
def gindexBits (g : Nat) : List Bool       -- gindex → path bits, MSB-first

def Node.setAt (n : Node) (g : Nat) (newSubtree : Node) : Node
def Node.setManyAt : Node → List (List Bool × Node) → Node
```

`setAt` recurses on `gindexBits g`, allocating one new `pair`
per level (left or right child rebound; the other shared) and
clearing the cache slot (`none`) for the new pair. Sibling
subtrees on the off-path side are returned by reference, so the
allocation count for one field update is exactly
`depth(structure) + 1` `pair` cells.

The single recursion on a `List Bool` of bits — instead of an
arithmetic gindex traversal — was deliberately chosen so that
the **Nimbus February 2025 mainnet gindex bug** (off-by-one on
list-length leaf positions) is *unrepresentable* in our walker.
There is no integer arithmetic on the gindex once the bits are
extracted; the walker pattern-matches on the bit list.

`setManyAt` is the batched form. The naïve approach — calling
`setAt` once per write — would allocate fresh spine cells for
*each* write, even when two writes share path prefixes. The
batched walker partitions the writes by their first bit at each
level and recurses once per partition, so writes that share a
prefix share the corresponding spine allocations.

For a multi-field update on a container of depth `d` with `k`
writes and `s` levels of shared spine, this drops the allocation
count from `k · d` to roughly `d + k · (d − s)`. That's the
optimisation Lodestar's `ViewDU` and Lighthouse's
`with_updates_leaves` ship; we ship it as a single call site
because the `sszUpdate` macro batches the writes at expansion
time.

### `TreeBacked` / `CachedSSZ` value wrapper

`packages/SizzLean/SizzLean/Cache/TreeBacked.lean`.

```lean
structure TreeBacked (H : Type) (T : Type) [Hasher H] [SSZRepr T] where
  view : T
  tree : Node

abbrev CachedSSZ := TreeBacked
```

Two fields: the value-level `view : T` (so reads bypass the
cache entirely — see `sszGet` below) and the persistent
Merkle-tree `tree : Node`. The hasher `H` is part of the *type*,
so mixing hashers within one cached value is a type error rather
than a silent root mismatch — the cache cells were filled by
`H`'s `combine`, and a subsequent read with a different `H'`
would observe wrong bytes.

`CachedSSZ` is the *user-facing* alias; the user constructs
through `CachedSSZ.ofValue Sha256 v`, reads via dot notation /
`sszGet`, and updates via `sszUpdate`. `TreeBacked` is the
*internal* name retained where the gindex / spine vocabulary
matters (in `setManyAt`, in the macro's emission paths). Both
names refer to the same `structure`.

### The `sszUpdate` macro (write side)

`packages/SizzLean/SizzLean/Cache/Update.lean`.

User syntax:

```lean
sszUpdate t with
  epoch                          := 42,
  message.slot                   := newSlot,
  blockRoots[i]                  := r,
  validators[i].effectiveBalance := newBalance
```

The term elaborator (`elabSszUpdate`) inspects the base term `t`'s
type at expansion time and emits one of three specialised forms:

* **Cached path** (`TreeBacked H T` / `CachedSSZ H T`). The
  elaborator computes path bits for each clause at expansion
  time (the structure reflection is fully known), groups them
  into a single `List (List Bool × Node)`, and emits one call
  to `Node.setManyAt`. The view side becomes a chained
  `{ t.view with f := v, … }`. Net result: one `setManyAt`
  walk per `sszUpdate` statement.

* **Uncached path** (`UncachedSSZ H T`). Emits a plain
  `{ view := { t.view with f := v, … } }` struct rewrite. No
  Merkle vocabulary; closes by `rfl` in proofs.

* **Box path** (`SSZ.Box H T`). Emits a two-arm `match` on the
  Box constructor, dispatching each arm to the corresponding
  per-flavour emission above. The Box value's flavour is
  preserved across updates.

The macro emits structural-sharing-friendly code regardless of
the input shape: an `SSZ.FastBox`-built value stays Fast through
every chain of `sszUpdate`s, and the cached spine stays
`Node.setManyAt`-batched even across the box dispatch.

For Vector / SSZList element updates with *composite* element
types (the index syntax `vec[i] := v` on `Vector Validator n` /
`SSZList Validator n`), the cached path is fully supported. For
*basic-packed* elements (`Vector UInt64 n[i] := bal`) the cached
path is rejected at expansion time, because basic packing
requires a chunk-rebuild that the flat macro doesn't ship —
whole-vector replacement (`balances := balances.set! i bal`) is
the current workaround; targeted basic-packed indexing is a
planned Sub-F follow-up gated on measured need.

### The `sszGet` macro (read side)

The read-side companion in the same file. Identical path syntax
to `sszUpdate`, expanding purely syntactically to
`base.view.<path>`:

```lean
sszGet b epoch                          -- → b.view.epoch
sszGet b message.slot                   -- → b.view.message.slot
sszGet b validators[i]                  -- → b.view.validators[i]
sszGet b validators[i].effectiveBalance -- → b.view.validators[i].effectiveBalance
```

Reads bypass the tree side entirely — they project the
value-level `view : T` and walk Lean's standard struct /
array accessors. The cached and uncached flavours give
*observationally identical* read behaviour.

The macro is a one-line `macro_rules` rewrite. It adds no
typeclass dispatch, no elaborator branching, no overhead. The
post-expansion term is a chain of Lean's built-in projection
notation, so `rfl` / `decide` / `simp` proofs about reads close
exactly as if the user had typed `.view.f.g[i].h` directly. The
only thing the macro buys is hiding `.view` from the
documented user surface — the user types `sszGet`, never
`.view`.

### Coherence invariant and its safety net

The single load-bearing invariant on the cache layer:

> For every `t : TreeBacked H T`, `t.hashTreeRootCached =
> SSZ.hashTreeRoot H t.view`.

This is *not* a kernel-checked theorem. Per
[`research/cache-research.md`](research/cache-research.md) §5,
the cache is intentionally outside the formal-verification
frontier — the verified spec layer is what closes the
correctness story, and the cache is asserted equivalent to it.
The safety net is two property tests:

* `SizzLeanTests/TreeBackedCoherence.lean` —
  `t.hashTreeRootCached = SSZ.hashTreeRoot Sha256 t.view`
  on the example containers, fired via `native_decide` at
  build time.
* `SizzLeanTests/TreeBackedSetField.lean` /
  `MultiSetterIndex.lean` — PRNG-driven property tests for the
  `sszUpdate` emission paths, against the spec oracle.

Plus the cross-implementation `ssz_static` upstream-vector
sweep (`packages/LeanEthCS/...`), which exercises the
production cached path against the consensus-spec-tests release
on 38991 / 38991 minimal-preset cases across every fork through
Fulu.

This is the same safety-net shape `remerkleable` ships
(`tests/test_roundtrip.py` plus consensus-spec-tests
integration in `eth2spec`).

## Phase 17 — open optimisations

Five sub-stages with a microbenchmark in
`packages/SizzLean/SizzLeanBench/` (run via `just bench`). Status:

| Sub-stage | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 17a | Pending overlay (closure-based, read-from-view at commit) | **shipped** |
| 17b.0 | Batched FFI primitive `sha256BatchCombine` + named axiom | **shipped** |
| 17b.1 | AVX-512 / SHA-NI inner loop in the C shim | **not done** (FFI surface ready; swap is C-side only) |
| 17b.2 | Level-aware Lean walker that consumes `combineBatch` | **not done** (depends on 17b.1 to be worth wiring) |
| 17c | Hash-consing primitive (`Node.mkPair`) | **library primitive shipped; not on default cached path** |
| 17d | `@[specialize]` on the three SSZ surfaces | **shipped** |
| 17e | Fused commit walk (`Node.commitAndHash`) + pre-cached `Node.ofShape` builders | **shipped** |

The measured-need gate that originally fronted Stage 17 has been
crossed in two directions: the benches now show *which* of the
shipped optimisations deliver real wins (17a + 17e together are
the headline cache-vs-pure ratio on realistic workloads — see
S6/S7 in the bench) and *which* ship infrastructure pending a
follow-up to light up (17b.1 / 17b.2 — needs the SIMD inner loop
and the level-aware walker). Each section below records both the
design and the measured result; the per-sub-stage details
remain accurate as implementation references. They document what
the optimisation does, the data structure it needs, the prior
art we're learning from, the specific Lean integration shape,
and the proof-side invariant each must respect.

### End-to-end win: pure vs all-optimisations-on

For the *combined* effect across a realistic workload — what
the library delivers when a user just uses its default surface
rather than reaching for the spec — see
`SizzLeanBench/Pipeline.lean`. It compares a pure-spec pipeline
(plain `T`, Lean record-updates, spec calls for every read /
serialise) against the same workload run through `TreeBacked` +
`sszUpdate` + `TreeBacked.serialize`, on two shapes:

| Workload | Pure | Optimised | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| state-transition (8 writes, 8 reads, 1 serialise) | ~283 µs | ~89 µs | **3.2×** |
| process-then-emit (8 writes, 1 read, 1 serialise) | ~53 µs | ~45 µs | 1.2× |

The state-transition pattern shows the dramatic win because
every per-update root read in the pure path pays a full re-hash
(~28 µs × 8 = ~224 µs), while the cached path only walks the
dirty spine (~10 µs each) plus the serialised cache trims the
final emit. The process-then-emit pattern shows a smaller win
because there's only one root read — the SHA-256 work itself is
the dominant cost, the same in both paths.

`@[specialize]` (17d) fires in both columns (compile-time, can't
be toggled at runtime). 17b batched SHA-256 and 17c hash-consing
are *not* exercised by the default cached path — they're opt-in
through separate APIs (`sha256BatchCombine` / `Node.mkPair`); see
their dedicated bench files for in-isolation measurements.

The ordering below is the default sequence (highest-impact-
first per Lighthouse's Milhouse benchmarks and Lodestar's
`ViewDU` paper); profiling on a specific workload may re-order.

### Stage 17a — Pending overlay (closure-based, read-from-view) — **shipped**

The pending overlay is folded into the existing `TreeBacked`
structure rather than exposed as a separate `ViewDU` type. Every
`TreeBacked H T` carries:

```lean
def PendingWrite (T : Type) : Type := T → Option Node

structure TreeBacked (H : Type) (T : Type) [Hasher H] [SSZRepr T] where
  view     : T                                          -- always current
  treeBase : Thunk Node                                 -- deferred until first root
  pending  : Std.TreeMap Nat (PendingWrite T) := {}     -- gindex → closure
```

The deferral lives at two levels:

* **`treeBase : Thunk Node`** — `TreeBacked.ofValue` builds it as
  `Thunk.mk (fun _ => Node.ofShape …)`. No tree-shape work runs
  at construction; the first `hashTreeRoot` forces it once and
  `Thunk`'s memo carries the result.
* **`pending`** — each `sszUpdate` clause emits a *closure*
  (`T → Option Node`) that, at commit time, projects the
  relevant sub-value out of the **current** `view` and builds
  the matching sub-tree via `Node.ofShape`. Closures that
  return `none` (most commonly because a runtime index was OOB
  and `Array.set!` was a view-side no-op) are dropped at commit.

`hashTreeRootCached` runs every closure against the current
`view`, hands the surviving `(gindexBits, Node)` pairs to
`Node.commitAndHash` (§17e), and stores the cached output back
into `treeBase` for the next commit's starting point.

The win is threefold:

1. **Automatic cross-statement batching.** A chain of N
   single-clause `sszUpdate`s + one root read produces *one*
   `commitAndHash` walk, not N spine walks.
2. **No work on overwritten writes.** Two `sszUpdate`s at the
   same gindex collapse via `TreeMap.insert`; only the last
   closure ever runs.
3. **Parent/child coherence for free.** Closures all share one
   `view`. A parent's closure projects `view.field` which already
   reflects every later child write the user issued. The
   `commitAndHash` "drop deeper write at same level as a `[]`-path
   write" rule then drops the redundant child entry without
   semantic loss — because the parent already encoded it.

**Why read from view at commit rather than capture at insert.**
An earlier design captured `(shape, value)` snapshots at insert
time. That broke on parent/child gindex relations: write
`parent := y` then `parent.child := z` left both in pending; at
commit the parent's snapshot `y` had no `z` in it, and the
commit-time drop discarded the child entry — so the committed
root reflected `y` while the view reflected `y` with
`child := z`. Reading from view at commit closes that gap by
construction.

**OOB-aware closures.** The macro emits a bounds check around
each index step in the projection path: `xs[i]!` becomes
`if i < xs.size then some (Node.ofShape … xs[i]!) else none`.
This mirrors view-side `Array.set!`-on-OOB-is-a-no-op so the
cache stays in lockstep with the view regardless of the
element type's `Inhabited` default.

**Measured result.** Benchmarks at `packages/SizzLean/bench/`:

* **S6 BlockProcessingLarge** (32 slots × 8 writes on
  `ValidatorSet256`): cached ~43 ms, pure ~102 ms — **2.4×
  cached faster**.
* **S7 FuluStateTransition** (mainnet preset, ~1024 validators,
  16-slot state-transition simulation): cached ~2.6 s, pure
  ~5.2 s — **2.0× cached faster**.

Regression coverage:

* `SizzLeanTests/PendingPrefixConflict.lean` — 5 cases on
  parent/child gindex prefix relations.
* `SizzLeanTests/PendingListShrink.lean` — 8 cases on
  list-shrink + stale-index writes (including a non-zero
  `Inhabited` element that surfaces the bounds-check requirement).
* `SizzLeanTests/WidthsAndLists.lean` — 32 cases on basic widths
  (Bool, UInt8/16/32/64, BitVec 128/256) × list-size changes.

**Original design sketch follows** — kept for historical
context; the shipped form removes the separate `ViewDU`
wrapper.

**What it does.** Accumulate pending writes in an ordered map
keyed by gindex; on `commit`, replay them in gindex-ascending
order through `Node.setManyAt`, batching across path prefixes
just like the existing within-statement `sszUpdate` already
does — but now *across* statements.

The current `sszUpdate` already batches writes within one
statement: `sszUpdate s with x := v, y := w` shares the
spine work between `x` and `y`. What it doesn't batch is the
common state-transition pattern of

```lean
let s := sszUpdate s with x := 1
let s := sszUpdate s with y := 2
let s := sszUpdate s with z := 3
-- then read the root
```

— three separate `setManyAt` calls walking three separate
spines. With `ViewDU`, those three writes are accumulated into a
`Std.TreeMap Nat Node` and committed in one walk on the
subsequent root read (or the first time a function asks for the
committed shape).

**Data structure.** A new module
`SizzLean/Cache/Overlay.lean`:

```lean
structure ViewDU (H T : Type) [Hasher H] [SSZRepr T] where
  base    : TreeBacked H T
  pending : Std.TreeMap Nat Node    -- gindex → replacement subtree
```

**Commit.**

```lean
def ViewDU.commit (v : ViewDU H T) : TreeBacked H T :=
  let updates := v.pending.toList.map fun (g, n) => (gindexBits g, n)
  { v.base with tree := v.base.tree.setManyAt updates }
```

The `toList` traversal of an ordered map yields entries in
gindex-ascending order, which means `setManyAt`'s
partition-by-first-bit step sees the writes in a path-grouped
order naturally — every shared prefix appears as a contiguous
run of writes.

**Prior art.**

* `remerkleable` does not ship a deferred-update overlay
  (single-threaded write-through). The pattern below is lifted
  from Lodestar's `View` / `ViewDU` distinction
  (`lodestar/packages/state-transition/src/cache/view-du.ts`),
  which adds a "deferred update" wrapper on top of the
  underlying persistent tree.
* Lighthouse's Milhouse `with_updates_leaves`
  (`milhouse/src/tree.rs`) is the same concept, batching leaf
  updates into a single tree walk. The cited speedup over
  per-leaf updates is 5–10× on a 1000-validator slashing
  scenario.
* Teku's `MutableSchemaList` does it differently — by
  duplicating the spine into a writeable copy and rebatching at
  the end. We're following the immutable-base + pending-map
  shape because it matches Lean's reference-counted runtime
  semantics better.

**Microbenchmark target.** `bench/`: 1000 sequential
`setField`-style writes on a `BeaconState`-shaped container
should commit in close to one full-spine walk's worth of
hashing — i.e. the per-write cost in the ViewDU pipeline should
be near-zero once the deferral is in effect.

**Proof-side invariant.** `ViewDU` doesn't touch
`UncachedSSZ` / plain `T` / `SSZ.PureBox`. The overlay is a
strictly cached-path optimisation. The pure / proof path stays
single-statement-typed and continues to use Lean's built-in
record-update syntax for any chained "write then read" pattern.

**Risk.** Medium. Spine deduplication is the tricky part — two
writes whose gindex paths share a prefix should share the
intermediate `pair` allocations the underlying `setManyAt` makes.
That's already what `setManyAt` does, so the ViewDU layer is
mostly "accumulate, sort, hand off to `setManyAt`". The risk is
on the read interface: any read between a `setField` and the
commit must observe the *would-be-committed* value, not the
underlying `base.view`. The straightforward fix is to mirror
the pending writes on the view side too, but that requires
either a second `Std.TreeMap String Dynamic`-shaped pending-view
map (not pleasant) or running the commit on every read (defeats
the deferral). Both are surveyed in
[`research/cache-research.md`](research/cache-research.md) §7.

### Stage 17b — Batched SHA-256

This sub-stage now tracks three pieces of work separately, in
parallel with PLAN.md §Stage 17b.

#### Stage 17b.0 — FFI primitive + Lean wrapper + axiom — **shipped**

The FFI primitive `sha256BatchCombine`
(`csrc/sha256_batch.c`), the Lean wrapper
(`SizzLean/Hasher/Sha256Batch.lean`), the named equivalence
axiom `sha256BatchCombine_eq_spec`, and seven empirical-
equivalence test cases (`SizzLeanTests/Sha256BatchEquivalence.lean`).
The first-cut C shim shares one `EVP_MD_CTX` across the pair
array, avoiding N × allocation cycles.

**Measured result.** On a 128-pair (depth-7 SSZ bottom layer)
fixture:

| Path | Time |
|---|---|
| **pure-Lean (128 `LeanSha256.combine` calls)** | **~34 ms** |
| 128 scalar `sha256Combine` calls (FFI) | ~41 µs |
| `sha256BatchCombine` (one FFI call) | ~41 µs |

FFI scalar and FFI batched are within noise of each other —
both ~830× faster than the pure-Lean reference. The empirical
finding for the batched path: shared-EVP-context batching alone
doesn't beat scalar because OpenSSL's per-pair SHA-256
compression work (~300 ns × 128 = ~40 µs) dominates the
context-allocation amortisation (~10 ns × 127 saved calls =
~2 µs).

The pure-Lean column matters for proof-side code that pins
`H := Sha256Spec` — kernel-reducible but slower; the gap to
the FFI columns measures the FFI's value at hash work. Proofs
about state-transition functions don't pay this cost because
they reduce structurally and don't actually compute hashes.

#### Stage 17b.1 — Cross-platform SIMD shim — **not done**

**Goal.** Replace the scalar EVP loop inside
`csrc/sha256_batch.c` with a per-architecture dispatch that uses
real SIMD or hardware-SHA where available. Single C shim, one
library per architecture; the Lean-side surface
(`sha256BatchCombine`) and the axiom (`sha256BatchCombine_eq_spec`)
are unchanged.

* **x86_64 (Intel + AMD)** — link **Intel ISA-L**
  (BSD-3-Clause, Intel-maintained, ships in Debian/Ubuntu /
  RHEL / Alpine as `libisal-crypto-dev`). Its `sha256_mb` API
  hashes 4 (SSE) / 8 (AVX2) / 16 (AVX-512) buffers in parallel
  — auto-dispatched via CPUID at runtime. Works identically on
  AMD CPUs that support the same SIMD ISA (Zen 1+ for AVX2,
  Zen 4+ for AVX-512).
* **ARM64 (Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton, ARM servers)** — fall
  back to **OpenSSL** (already in our link line). OpenSSL's EVP
  path uses ARMv8 SHA-Ext on supported CPUs (every Apple
  M-series chip, Graviton 3+, etc.) — each single-pair hash is
  already ~30–50 ns. The "batched" path on ARM is a tight loop
  over fast single-pair calls; the function-call amortisation
  is the win, ~1.5×, not the 8–16× of x86 SIMD.
* **Fallback** (older ARM without SHA-Ext, RISC-V, etc.) —
  OpenSSL EVP loop. Same code path as the ARM64 case.

```c
// csrc/sha256_batch.c
#if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(_M_X64)
  #include <isa-l_crypto/sha256_mb.h>
  // ISA-L multi-buffer: submit N pairs, flush, collect digests.
#else
  // OpenSSL EVP loop — hardware-SHA on ARMv8 SHA-Ext CPUs.
#endif
```

`lakefile.lean` conditionally appends `-lisal_crypto` to
`moreLinkArgs` when the target triple starts with `x86_64`.

| Architecture | Expected `sha256BatchCombine` (128 pairs) | Speedup over scalar |
|---|---|---|
| x86_64 with AVX-512 | ~3 µs | ~13× |
| x86_64 with AVX2 | ~5 µs | ~8× |
| x86_64 with SSE4.2 + SHA-NI | ~10 µs | ~4× |
| ARM64 with ARMv8 SHA-Ext | ~25–30 µs | ~1.5× (amortisation only) |
| ARM64 / other without hardware SHA | ~40 µs | 1× (no change) |

**Trust footprint.** No change. The named axiom
`sha256BatchCombine_eq_spec` still asserts pointwise agreement
with the pure-Lean reference; the equivalence test re-runs
identically.

#### Stage 17b.2 — Level-aware Lean traversal — **not done; depends on 17b.1**

**Goal.** Plug the (now-fast) batched primitive into
`merkleRootWithCache`'s recursive walk. The default
`box.hashTreeRoot` path then gathers per-level sibling pairs and
issues one batched call per tree level instead of per-pair scalar
calls.

**Deliverable.** `SizzLean/Cache/MerkleTree/MerkleBatch.lean` —
a level-aware variant of `merkleRootWithCache` that gathers
`pair _ _ none` cells at each depth and calls
`sha256BatchCombine` once per level. Wired as the runtime
implementation of `merkleRootWithCache` (via `@[implemented_by]`
if the signatures match; otherwise as the cached-Box path's
default walk).

After this lands, the scenarios bench's `S1`/`S3`/`S4`/`S6`
ValidatorSet rows should drop dramatically on x86 with AVX-512
(approx 3–5× faster cached column) and modestly on ARM (~1.5×).

**Dependency on 17b.1.** Without the SIMD shim, integrating
this delivers zero measurable improvement on the scenarios
bench (the bench data on the scalar shim confirmed this: FFI
batched ≈ FFI scalar at ~40 µs / 128 pairs). 17b.2 is only
worth doing once 17b.1 ships.

**Original design notes follow** — kept for the prior-art
references and the data-structure sketch; both still apply to
the follow-up SIMD path.

**What it does.** Plumb a SHA-NI / AVX-512 FFI primitive that
hashes 4–8 sibling pairs in parallel; alter
`merkleRootWithCache` to collect batchable pairs at one tree
level before issuing the batched call. The Intel SHA-NI
instruction set hashes one block per cycle per pipe; AVX-512
runs ~4 blocks in parallel. On modern x86 servers, batched
SHA-256 is the largest single perf lever after the cache is in
place — Lighthouse measures ~3× speedup on cold-root
computation.

**Data structure.** Two new files:

* `csrc/sha256_batch.c` — new C shim wrapping OpenSSL's
  `EVP_DigestUpdate` parallel-pipe mode (or, more aggressively,
  a hand-tuned SHA-NI / AVX-512 implementation along the lines
  of `gohashtree`'s `sha256_avx_x4` and `sha256_avx512_x16`).
* `SizzLean/Hasher/Sha256Batch.lean` —
  `@[extern "lean_ssz_sha256_batch"] opaque sha256Batch :
  Array (ByteArray × ByteArray) → Array ByteArray`.
* `SizzLean/Cache/MerkleTree/MerkleBatch.lean` — a variant of
  `merkleRootWithCache` that collects sibling pairs across a
  level before issuing one batched call. The traversal is
  level-aware: at depth `d`, gather every `pair l r none` whose
  `l` and `r` have already-resolved roots, hash them in one
  batch, write back the cached roots, and recurse.

**Prior art.**

* `gohashtree` (Prysm's hashing backend) is the reference
  implementation of the AVX-512 path. Its `sha256_avx_x4`
  function hashes four message blocks in parallel and is the
  basis for our `lean_ssz_sha256_batch` shape.
* `remerkleable` does not batch (Python-side it would be
  pointless). The batching pattern is a C-level concern; the
  Lean-side traversal that *feeds* it is the new contribution.
* Lighthouse's Milhouse uses `gohashtree`'s `HashChunks` API for
  bulk-leaf hashing only (not for interior nodes); we'd push
  the batching one level deeper into the recursive walk.

**Dependency on Stage 15.** The Stage 15 conformance story is
"FFI Sha256 ≡ pure-Lean `Sha256Spec` on 185 cases". A batched
primitive would need a parallel empirical equivalence — either
"FFI sha256Batch on a sibling pair equals two scalar
`Sha256Spec.combine` calls on the same inputs" or, more
formally, a `@[csimp]` proof. The honest answer for shipping is
*neither* — the batched primitive stays a performance shim in
the TCB behind its own assertion, just like the scalar FFI
shim today. The Stage 15 axioms (`sha256Hash_eq_spec`,
`sha256Combine_eq_spec`) cover the scalar surface; a parallel
axiom `sha256Batch_eq_spec : ∀ pairs, sha256Batch pairs =
pairs.map (fun (l, r) => Sha256Spec.combine l r)` would extend
the empirical-equivalence story to the batched primitive.

**Microbenchmark target.** Cold-root of a fully-populated
mainnet-preset `BeaconState` (~1M validators) — should drop
from `gohashtree`-comparable scalar timing to within ~50% of
`gohashtree`'s batched implementation.

**Proof-side invariant.** Wired as an `@[implemented_by]` swap
on `merkleRootWithCache` (or as a new opt-in entry point), not
as a change to the `Hasher` typeclass. The abstract
`Hasher Sha256Spec` instance — what `SSZ.PureBox` /
`UncachedWith Sha256Spec` paths use — sees no change.

**Risk.** Medium. The FFI shim is straightforward; the
level-aware traversal that maximises batch fullness is the
design lever. Naïve batching (one batch per level) leaves the
parallel pipes underutilised when the tree is sparse; the
sophisticated version (batch fullness with cross-level work
stealing) needs careful design.

### Stage 17c — Hash-consing — **library primitive shipped; not on user interface**

**Shipped as a library primitive (not wired into the cached
path).** A global `IO.Ref`-backed bounded-LRU cache
(`SizzLean/Cache/MerkleTree/HashCons.lean`, default capacity
4096) plus the `Node.mkPair` smart constructor that consults
the cache. On a cache hit (same 32-byte root previously seen),
returns the cached `Node` cell; on a miss, allocates fresh and
inserts. `Node.mkPair` is opt-in — existing `.pair`
allocations in `setAt` / `Build.lean` / etc. continue
unchanged, and `merkleRootWithCache` does **not** call into the
consing cache. The user-facing `box.hashTreeRoot` therefore sees
no consing today; this counts as in-flight Stage 17c work.

**Measured result.** On the smart-constructor call:

| Path | Time |
|---|---|
| `Node.mkPair` cache hit | ~180 ns |
| `Node.mkPair` cache miss (fresh insert) | ~230 ns |

The standing micro-bench on the scenarios fixture set (single
root on `ValidatorSet16`, no inter-tree subtree redundancy)
showed consing **slowed every root call by ~9×** — the
cache-lookup overhead per pair is paid on every interior node,
and the workload offers no hits to amortise it. The win shape
ChainSafe documents (~30% heap reduction) only materialises on
multi-tree archival / gossip-aggregation workloads where many
similar block-states are kept resident.

**Default-OFF when integrated.** When this is eventually wired
into the default cached path so the user no longer has to know
about consing, the **default configuration must keep consing
off**, with an explicit `Box`-construction opt-in for workloads
that benefit. Concretely: `SSZ.FastBox v` continues to return a
consing-off Box; `SSZ.FastBox v (consing := true)` (or a similar
named-argument toggle on the construction site) is the
opt-in for archival / gossip-aggregation use. Defaulting it on
would regress every non-archival scenario by the ~9× factor
above.

Also deferred: weak-reference semantics. Lean 4 doesn't expose
a weak-ref API; the bounded-LRU fallback (wipe-all eviction
when capacity is hit) is what ships. For workloads that justify
weak refs, the swap is local to `HashCons.lean`.

**Original design notes follow** — the prior-art map and the
weak-ref design discussion both still apply to the follow-up.

**What it does.** Dedupe identical populated subtrees globally
via a weak `HashMap (Hash32) Node`. Complements `ZERO_HASHES`'s
zero-subtree dedup (which handles only the canonical zero
case): if two distinct `BeaconState`s end up with identical
`validators[42:50]` ranges, both can share the same `pair`
allocation across the tree.

**Data structure.** A new module
`SizzLean/Cache/MerkleTree/HashCons.lean`:

```lean
private opaque hashConsCache : IO.Ref (Std.HashMap ByteArray Node)

def Node.mkPairConsed (left right : Node) (root : Option ByteArray) :
    BaseIO Node := do
  match root with
  | none => pure (.pair left right none)
  | some r =>
      let cache ← hashConsCache.get
      match cache.find? r with
      | some existing => pure existing
      | none =>
          let n := .pair left right (some r)
          hashConsCache.set (cache.insert r n)
          pure n
```

(weak-reference semantics omitted in the sketch — Lean's
runtime needs a real `IO.Ref` with the appropriate
`@[implemented_by]` swap to `lean_alloc_cached_weak`.)

**Prior art.**

* `remerkleable` does not hash-cons (Python's reference
  semantics make it awkward; a single-state usage doesn't show
  the win).
* ChainSafe's `persistent-merkle-tree` *does* — it ships a
  global `WeakMap<Root, Node>` and consults it on every `pair`
  construction. Their measurement: a 30% reduction in heap
  usage on a `BeaconState` archive workload (storing 100
  consecutive states), because validator-list prefixes are
  highly redundant across slots.
* Lighthouse-Milhouse holds back from hash-consing because the
  Rust-side ref-counted persistent tree already shares spines
  intra-state; the inter-state win is the lever.

**Microbenchmark target.** Memory: storing N consecutive
`BeaconState`s should use proportionally less heap than `N ×
fresh-state` once `N ≥ 50`. CPU: a `merkleRootWithCache` hit on
an interned `Node` should be the same `pair _ _ (some r)` short-
circuit it is today — no extra work on the hot path.

**Proof-side invariant.** Pure cache substitution. `Sha256Spec`
/ uncached / plain-`T` paths never allocate `Node` cells; the
hash-cons cache is invisible to them. Two `Node` values that
hash-cons to the same allocation must be observationally
indistinguishable (`merkleRoot` and `setAt` agree on both);
that's automatic since interning happens only when the cached
root is *already* known.

**Risk.** Medium. Lean's runtime reference-counting interacts
with weak references non-trivially. Getting the lifecycle right
needs care — a `WeakRef` API would be cleaner, but Lean
currently lacks one. The fallback is a bounded-LRU cache (no
weak references), which loses the unbounded-archive case but
keeps the common-case win.

### Stage 17d — Profile-guided `@[specialize]` — **shipped (pass 1)**

**Shipped.** `@[specialize]` attributes on the three
deriving-handler-emitted user-facing surfaces in
`SizzLean/Repr/Class.lean`: `SSZ.serialize`, `SSZ.deserialize`,
`SSZ.hashTreeRoot`. The compiler now monomorphises these at
each consensus type that calls them.

**Measured result.** On a `ValidatorShape` fixture (eight
fixed-size fields, ~144 bytes), 1000 iterations:

| Path | Time |
|---|---|
| **pure (`SSZ.hashTreeRoot Sha256` on plain `T`)** | **~7.4 µs** |
| cached (`TreeBacked.ofValue + .hashTreeRootCached`) | ~8.5 µs |

Pure wins by ~1 µs because the cached path adds `TreeBacked.ofValue`'s
`Node.ofShape` construction cost on every iteration — the
cache is for amortising across *multiple* reads on the same
value, which this single-shot bench doesn't exercise. For the
ValidatorShape's size, the post-`@[specialize]` baseline is
recorded; future hint changes compare against these columns.

The pass-2 step (site-local `@[specialize T]` annotations on
specific hot consensus types like `Validator` /
`BeaconBlockHeader` / per-fork `BeaconState` variants in
`LeanEthCS`) is deferred pending workload-specific profiling
that says it pays.

**Original design notes follow.**

**What it does.** Monomorphise the `SSZType`-driven generic
interpreter at the concrete consensus types that dominate the
profile. Each specialization removes one level of dispatch
overhead — the `Spec/HashTreeRoot.lean` recursion is currently
polymorphic in `s : SSZType`, and the generic code path pays a
dispatch tag check at every constructor.

**Data structure.** Pure attribute changes; no new module.

* `@[specialize]` annotations on the generic functions surfaced
  by the deriving handler (`packages/SizzLean/SizzLean/Repr/Deriving.lean`).
* `@[specialize SSZ.hashTreeRoot]`-style hints in the
  consensus-spec containers — but those go in `LeanEthCS`, not
  here.

**Prior art.**

* `remerkleable` does not specialise (Python; nothing to
  monomorphise). The pattern is borrowed from Lean's own stdlib
  (`Array.usize`, `USize.repr`) and from Coq's `Extraction
  Inline`.
* `gohashtree` and `fastssz` (the Go implementations) get the
  same effect via Go's per-call-site inlining, which is
  automatic; we need the explicit annotation because Lean's
  compiler is more conservative.

**Microbenchmark target.** At least one hot-path consensus type
(`Validator`, `BeaconBlockHeader`, `BeaconState`'s per-fork
variants) shows a measurable encode/decode/root-cost win after
the specialization. Realistic target: 1.5–2× on a single-type
microbench.

**Proof-side invariant.** Critical. `@[specialize]` is a
*recommendation to the compiler*; Lean's kernel still sees the
unspecialised definition for proof reduction. `rfl` / `decide`
close identically before and after. This is why 17d is the
only sub-stage that can touch shared deriving-handler output
without breaking the cross-stage invariant — the attribute
lands at runtime, not at proof-check time.

**Risk.** Low. `@[specialize]` is a hint; worst case it's
ignored by the compiler. No correctness consequence.

### Stage 17e — Fused commit walk + pre-cached `Node.ofShape` builders — **shipped**

**Shipped.** Two related optimisations that fuse work and trim
allocations on the cache layer's hot path:

* **`Node.commitAndHash`** (`Cache/MerkleTree/SetAt.lean`) —
  replaces the two-pass `setManyAt` → `merkleRootWithCache`
  sequence at commit time. One walk over the touched spine; each
  cell allocated once with its root computed inline.
  `commitAndHash` is what `hashTreeRootCached` calls when
  `pending` has writes; an empty overlay falls through to plain
  `merkleRootWithCache`.
* **Pre-cached `Node.ofShape` builders.** `Node.ofLeaves`,
  `Node.ofSubtrees`, `Node.mixInLength` now compute the parent's
  root inline (via `Node.rootOf` on the children, O(1) when the
  child is cached) and embed it as `(some root)` in the parent
  pair. A subsequent `merkleRootWithCache` on a fresh
  `Node.ofShape` output short-circuits at the top in O(1).

The serialisation cache originally planned for 17e was dropped:
`TreeBacked.serialize` is a pure function of `view`, with no
internal memo. Callers that need to broadcast the same bytes to
many consumers bind the result once and reuse it. The historical
design notes for that approach follow at the end of this section.

**Measured result.** S6 BlockProcessingLarge cached vs pure
moves from a 1.5× ratio (pre-fusion) to a 2.4× ratio
(post-fusion); the fused walk eliminates the per-spine duplicate
allocation that previously dominated S5's write-heavy column.

Coherence preserved: every cached-path coherence test
(`TreeBackedCoherence`, `PendingOverlayCoherence`,
`MultiSetterIndex`, `PendingPrefixConflict`, `PendingListShrink`,
`WidthsAndLists`) closes unchanged across the fusion.

**Historical design notes (serialisation cache, dropped) follow.**

**What it does.** Add an `Option ByteArray` slot to
`TreeBacked` that caches the most-recently-computed
serialisation. Any `setField` invalidates the slot; `SSZ.serialize`
consults the slot first. This is the targeted optimisation for
the gossip layer: re-encoding an unchanged block to push it
upstream becomes a `byte-copy` rather than a re-walk of the
tree.

**Data structure.** Extend the existing structure in
`Cache/TreeBacked.lean`:

```lean
structure TreeBacked (H T : Type) [Hasher H] [SSZRepr T] where
  view       : T
  tree       : Node
  serialized : Option ByteArray   -- new
```

* `TreeBacked.ofValue` sets `serialized := none`.
* `setField` and the `sszUpdate` cached emission set
  `serialized := none` on the result.
* `SSZ.serialize` is taught to check `t.serialized` first; if
  populated, the byte-copy returns immediately; otherwise the
  spec serialiser runs and the result is written back into the
  slot.

**Prior art.**

* `remerkleable` has a `to_obj` convention but does not cache
  the bytes. Adding the cache here is an Ethereum-specific
  optimisation aimed at the gossip layer (where the same block
  is re-encoded for every peer).
* Lighthouse's Beacon API cache and Lodestar's `messageBytes`
  cache do exactly this — a byte-form pinned to the SSZ value,
  invalidated on mutation. The invariant they maintain ("if
  `serialized = some b`, then `SSZ.serialize view = b`") is the
  one we're lifting.

**Microbenchmark target.** A microbench in `bench/` showing
that 1000 re-encodes of an unchanged `BeaconState` use O(bytes)
work instead of O(tree size).

**Proof-side invariant.** The new field is on `TreeBacked` only.
`UncachedSSZ` and `SSZ.PureBox` paths don't see it; the spec
`SSZ.serialize : T → ByteArray` on a plain `T` value doesn't
either. The cache is consulted only inside the cached
representation's serializer; the proof-side semantics is
unchanged.

**Risk.** Low. Mostly mechanical. The one wrinkle is `sszUpdate`:
the emission path on the cached side currently writes
`{ t with view := …, tree := … }`; it now writes
`{ t with view := …, tree := …, serialized := none }`. That's
one extra field per emission, fine.

## The cross-stage invariant — the pure path stays kernel-reducible

The whole point of `SSZ.PureBox` / `UncachedSSZ` / plain `T`
operating through `SSZ.hashTreeRoot Sha256Spec` is that proofs
about state-transition functions reduce in the Lean kernel
*with no cache invariant to thread through, no FFI to trust, no
opacity to hide behind `native_decide`*. Every Phase 17
optimisation preserves that property:

| Stage | Why the pure path is unaffected |
|---|---|
| 17a Overlay | Touches `TreeBacked` directly. `UncachedSSZ` has no spine to defer; plain `T` doesn't have a pending-writes map either. |
| 17b Batched SHA-256 | Wired as an `@[implemented_by]` swap on `merkleRootWithCache` (or behind `Hasher Sha256`). The abstract `Hasher` typeclass and the `Sha256Spec` instance are unchanged. |
| 17c Hash-consing | Operates on `Node` allocations. The pure spec path doesn't allocate `Node`s — it hashes through the `SSZType` recursion directly. |
| 17d `@[specialize]` | Compile-time recommendation. Lean's kernel sees the unspecialised definition for proof reduction; `rfl` / `decide` close identically before and after. |
| 17e Serialised cache | Slot on `TreeBacked` only. `UncachedSSZ` doesn't have it; `SSZ.serialize` on plain `T` doesn't consult it. |

Concretely: a theorem like `(bumpEpoch (SSZ.PureBox f0) 42).view
= { f0 with epoch := 42 }` closes by `rfl` today. After any or
all of 17a–e land, it must still close by `rfl`. Any change to
a Stage 17 deliverable that breaks that test belongs in a
different stage with a separate trust budget.

## Benchmarking and gating

Every Stage 17 sub-stage ships a microbenchmark in
`packages/SizzLean/SizzLeanBench/Scenarios/` showing before /
after numbers for its specific lever. The phase-wide target is
parity with `fastssz` on encode/decode and with `gohashtree` on
cached `hash_tree_root` (per ARCHITECTURE.md §2), but no
individual sub-stage carries that as its gate — each closes when
its specific optimisation lands with a measured win.

The bench scenarios:

| # | Scenario | Fixture | What it measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | ColdRoot | Validator / VS16 | First-walk overhead on small fixtures |
| S2 | BatchedWrites | Validator / VS16 | One slot's worth of writes + one root, small fixture |
| S3 | BlockProcessing | Validator / VS16 | 8 slots × (4 writes, root, serialise), small fixture |
| S4 | ColdRootLarge | VS256 | First-walk overhead at depth 12 |
| S5 | BatchedWritesLarge | VS256 | 512 writes + one root |
| S6 | BlockProcessingLarge | VS256 | 32 slots × (8 writes, root, serialise) — best single-number predictor of the cache win at scale |
| S7 | FuluStateTransition | `SizzLeanBench.Fulu.BeaconState` (mainnet preset, ~1024 validators) | Full state-transition simulation touching every major field shape |

Headline cached vs pure ratios on dev hardware:

* **S6 BlockProcessingLarge** — ~2.4× cached faster than pure
  (43 ms vs 102 ms); the production-shaped large workload.
* **S7 FuluStateTransition** — ~2.0× cached faster than pure
  (2.6 s vs 5.2 s); the realistic mainnet-shape regression gate.

S7's `BeaconState` types live in `SizzLeanBench/Fulu.lean` as a
bench-local reference copy so `SizzLeanBench` doesn't need a
`LeanEthCS` dependency (`LeanEthCS` already depends on
`SizzLean`, so the reverse would close a cycle).

The default ordering above is highest-impact-first per
Lighthouse and Lodestar benchmarks; profiling on a specific
workload may justify reordering. **Do not start a sub-stage
until a measurement says it's the next bottleneck on your
workload** — the cache backbone (Phase 14) is already enough
for most pipelines, and any of 17a–e adds maintenance surface
that should be paid for by measured gain.
