A Lean 4 implementation of Ethereum's
[SSZ](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/ssz/simple-serialize.md)
(Simple Serialize): serialization, deserialization, Merkleization,
cached-tree machinery, and the `sszUpdate` macro surface — all of
it sharing one library between production code and machine-checked
theorems.

## Why SizzLean

- **Write once, pick your backend.** Code written against this
  library runs on either of two implementations under the hood — a
  heavily optimised cached Merkle tree for production speed, or a
  simple uncached version that's friendly to Lean proofs. You
  choose at the call site; the spec or state-transition function
  you wrote doesn't change. No duplicated source between the
  runtime path and the verification path.

- **Validated against Ethereum's test corpus.** Passes both
  upstream SSZ suites from `ethereum/consensus-spec-tests` (release
  `v1.6.0-beta.0`) end-to-end on **both** preset configurations:
  `ssz_generic` (2188 / 2188 in-scope cases — the wire-format
  tests; 292 progressive-container cases are deliberately out of
  scope, see the "deliberately not implemented" table below),
  `ssz_static --config mainnet` (1585 / 1585 cases), and
  `ssz_static --config minimal` (38991 / 38991 cases) — every
  fork from Phase 0 through Fulu. SHA-256 passes the NIST CAVP
  vectors on every hasher the library ships.

- **Literate by default.** SizzLean sits at the intersection of
  two specialist worlds — SSZ and Lean 4 — and most readers only
  know one. The library is written with comments that teach the
  reader what the code does *and* the Lean idioms it uses, so a
  Lean-fluent reader can pick up the SSZ semantics and an
  SSZ-fluent reader can pick up the Lean. The cost is paid once
  when the code is written; the dividend compounds with every new
  contributor.

- **Fast hash-tree-root.** Updates are incremental: only the
  path from a changed field to the root rehashes. Multi-field
  updates batch the work across overlapping paths.

- **Zero boilerplate per type.** Add `deriving SSZRepr` to your
  Lean structure and you get serialization, deserialization,
  hash-tree-root, and the central correctness theorems — for
  free, per type, with no hand-written proofs.

- **Machine-checked correctness across most of SSZ.** The three
  central theorems — encode/decode roundtrip, non-malleability,
  and a schema-derived static size bound — are proved for every
  SSZ shape *except* the bit-level types and variable-field
  containers: `uintN 8 / 16 / 32 / 64`, `bool`, fixed-size
  `vector` and `list`, and `container` over fixed-size fields
  (recursively). Bit-level types (`bitvector`, `bitlist`) and
  mixed-field containers are pending — see
  [Proof coverage](#proof-coverage) for the per-constructor
  table.

- **Trust assumptions you can grep for.** Every reliance on the
  C SHA-256 implementation is a named Lean `axiom` (or its
  `@[extern] opaque` FFI declaration) in `SizzLean/Hasher/`, and
  shows up in the trust footprint of any proof that transitively
  uses it. The complete inventory is recoverable with one grep:

  ```bash
  grep -rEn '^axiom |^@\[extern' packages/SizzLean --include='*.lean'
  ```

  Today this returns three `axiom`s (`sha256Hash_eq_spec`,
  `sha256Combine_eq_spec`, `sha256BatchCombine_eq_spec`) plus
  three `@[extern] opaque` FFI primitives (`sha256Hash`,
  `sha256Combine`, `sha256BatchCombine`) — six real declarations,
  all under `SizzLean/Hasher/`. The grep also surfaces a handful
  of docstring mirrors (the same lines repeated inside a `/-! … -/`
  module-docstring block where the surrounding prose explains
  them); those are intentional, not extra trust commitments.
  Each `@[extern]` declaration is replaceable later by a
  `@[csimp]`-proved theorem; each equivalence `axiom` is
  replaceable by a plain proved `theorem`. Either swap leaves
  dependent theorem statements unchanged.

  *One additional trust class, auto-injected by tactics rather
  than hand-written.* The `decode_encode` and
  `serialize_injective` theorems' `.uintN 16 / 32 / 64` arms close
  via Lean core's `bv_decide` tactic, which adds one per-theorem
  `_native.bv_decide.ax_*` axiom (an LRAT SAT certificate cached
  as a Boolean reduction — same trust class as `native_decide`'s
  `Lean.ofReduceBool`). Visible via `#print axioms
  SizzLean.Proofs.decode_encode`. `encode_size_le_max` is
  axiom-free over the standard kernel axioms.

  *Out of central-theorem scope.* The cache layer
  (`Cache/MerkleTree/`) carries its own local trust commitments —
  `@[implemented_by]` on `zeroHashes` (substitutes a memoised
  `unsafeBaseIO` reader for the kernel-visible recurrence;
  equivalent by construction) and two `partial def`s
  (`Node.rootOf`, `Node.commitAndHash`) — and test gates under
  `SizzLeanTests/` use `native_decide` (one `Lean.ofReduceBool`
  axiom per call). Neither enters the trust footprint of the
  central theorems (`decode_encode` / `serialize_injective` /
  `encode_size_le_max`), but a global audit of the library
  should account for them too.

- **Pluggable hash function.** Today it's SHA-256. Tomorrow it
  can be Poseidon2 — or whatever the Beam Chain redesign settles
  on — without rewriting your containers, your proofs, or your
  cache logic.

- **Every Ethereum consensus fork covered.** Phase 0 through
  Gloas, including the new ePBS containers.

## Scope

Provides the SSZ *library* — types and primitives. Consensus-spec
container definitions (Phase0 → Gloas) live in the sibling
`LeanEthCS` package.

## Status

**Experimental, conformance-validated.** Every SSZ type used by
the Ethereum consensus spec from Phase 0 through Gloas is
implemented. Upstream test suites (`ethereum/consensus-spec-tests
v1.6.0-beta.0`) pass clean on **both** preset configurations:

* `ssz_generic --all` — **2188 / 2188** in-scope cases passed,
  0 failed. Plus **292** deliberately skipped progressive-container
  cases (see the "deliberately not implemented" table); the
  conformance harness classifies them as `out of library scope`,
  not failures.
* `ssz_static --config mainnet --all` — **1585 / 1585** cases
  passed across every fork Phase 0 → Fulu.
* `ssz_static --config minimal --all` — **38991 / 38991** cases
  passed across every fork Phase 0 → Fulu.

Per-PR CI runs the `--limit 1` smoke; the full sweep across both
presets is the umbrella `just official-ssz-vector-tests-all`
target.

Gloas and EIP-7805 test vectors exist in the v1.6.0-beta.0 corpus
but are not yet covered by the CLI dispatch table or the harness's
`FORKS` list — they're a planned LeanEthCS extension, not a
SizzLean-library gap.

### SSZ types implemented

| Type | Notes |
|---|---|
| `uintN` for `N ∈ {8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}` | Per spec; covers all currently-used widths |
| `boolean` | Single-byte `0x00` / `0x01` |
| `Vector[T, N]` | Fixed-length list |
| `List[T, N]` | Variable-length list with cap `N` and mix-in-length root |
| `Bitvector[N]` | Fixed-length bit array |
| `Bitlist[N]` | Variable-length bit array with trailing-`1` delimiter |
| `Container` | Heterogeneous record / struct — every consensus container is one of these |

### SSZ types deliberately *not* implemented

These forms appear in the SSZ spec but are not used by any
consensus-spec fork through Gloas, so the library omits them
to keep the core proof obligation small:

| Type | Source | Status here |
|---|---|---|
| `Union[T₁, …, Tₙ]` | core SSZ spec | unimplemented — no fork uses it |
| `ProgressiveContainer(active_fields=[…])` | EIP-7495 | unimplemented — no fork adopted EIP-7495 |
| `StableContainer[N]` + `Profile` | EIP-7495 (legacy form) | unimplemented |
| `ProgressiveList[T]` / `ProgressiveBitlist` | EIP-7916 | unimplemented |
| `CompatibleUnion({sel: type, …})` | EIP-8016 | unimplemented |

ARCHITECTURE.md §8 carries the recipe for reintroducing any of
these the day a fork adopts them — they slot back into `SSZType`
as new constructors without disrupting the existing layers.

### Proof coverage

The three central theorems — `decode_encode` (roundtrip),
`serialize_injective` (non-malleability), and
`encode_size_le_max` (size bound) — are landed on the
`SSZType.BasicSupported` cut (`Spec/BasicSupported.lean`).
Per-constructor breakdown:

| `SSZType` constructor | `decode_encode` | `serialize_injective` | `encode_size_le_max` | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| `.uintN 8` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | closes by `rfl` after one `unfold` |
| `.uintN 16` | ✅ ¹ | ✅ ¹ | ✅ | `bv_decide` on the LE identity |
| `.uintN 32` | ✅ ¹ | ✅ ¹ | ✅ | `bv_decide` |
| `.uintN 64` | ✅ ¹ | ✅ ¹ | ✅ | `bv_decide` |
| `.bool` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | exhaustive `cases` + `rfl` |
| `.vector t n` | ✅ ² | ✅ ² | ✅ ² | needs `0 < n` + `BasicSupported t` + `t.isFixedSize = true` |
| `.list t cap` | ✅ ³ | ✅ ³ | ✅ ³ | needs `BasicSupported t` + `t.isFixedSize = true` + `0 < t.fixedByteSize` |
| `.bitvector n` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | bit-packing inverse (`packBitsLE` / `unpackBitsLEAux`) not yet shipped |
| `.bitlist cap` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | needs bit-packing inverse + `msbPos` delimiter recovery |
| `.container fs` | see below | see below | see below | — |

¹ Adds one `_native.bv_decide.ax_*` axiom per arm (SAT certificate
for the multi-byte LE identity). `decode_encode`'s and
`serialize_injective`'s overall trust footprint is exactly these
three axioms plus the standard kernel axioms (`propext`,
`Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); `encode_size_le_max` adds
none.
² Recurses on the element type's `BasicSupported` witness via
the mutual `decode_encode` ↔ `decode_encode_containerFixed_aux`
block.
³ Same recursion shape as `.vector`.

`serialize_injective` is a direct corollary of `decode_encode`
(via `Except.ok.inj` + `Prod.mk.inj`), so its coverage tracks
`decode_encode` exactly.

#### `.container fs` — per-field type

A container `.container fs` is in `BasicSupported` exactly when
every field type is itself `BasicSupported` *and* fixed-size.
Allowed and excluded field types:

| Field type | Allowed as a container field? | Why |
|---|:---:|---|
| `.uintN 8 / 16 / 32 / 64` | ✅ | basic + fixed |
| `.bool` | ✅ | basic + fixed |
| `.vector t' n` (with `n > 0`, fixed-size `t'`, `BasicSupported t'`) | ✅ | nested vector, `(.vector t' n).isFixedSize = t'.isFixedSize` |
| `.container fs'` (with `BasicSupportedFieldsFixed fs'`) | ✅ | nested container, `(.container fs').isFixedSize = allFixedSize fs'` |
| `.bitvector n` | ❌ | not in `BasicSupported` yet (would qualify once the bitvector arm lands — it *is* fixed-size) |
| `.list t' cap` | ❌ | `(.list _ _).isFixedSize = false` — structurally excluded |
| `.bitlist cap` | ❌ | `(.bitlist _).isFixedSize = false` — structurally excluded |

For `.list` and `.bitlist` the exclusion is *structural*: they're
variable-size by SSZ definition, so they cannot satisfy
`BasicSupportedFieldsFixed`'s `t.isFixedSize = true` precondition.
Mixed-field containers (containers with at least one variable-size
field) are **outside `SSZType.Supported` entirely** — not just
outside `BasicSupported`. The spec layer flags this as
`TODO(stage-3-deferral)` in `Spec/Deserialize.lean`; closing it
requires extending `Supported` with a `containerVar` constructor
plus an offset-table-invariants proof.

In one line: containers with fields drawn from `{uintN8, uintN16,
uintN32, uintN64, bool, vectorFixed, containerFixed (recursively)}`
are proved; containers with any `bitvector`, `list`, or `bitlist`
field are not.

### Track in progress

**Phase 5 formal-verification widening** — the three central
theorems (roundtrip, non-malleability, size bound) are landed on
the `BasicSupported` cut, which now covers `uintN 8 / 16 / 32 /
64`, `bool`, fixed-size `vector` and `list`, and `container` over
fixed-size fields (recursively). Widening to a universal statement
over `SSZType.Supported` requires closing the remaining
`bitvector` and `bitlist` arms (bit-packing inverse), plus
extending `Supported` itself to admit mixed-field containers
(spec-layer follow-up). The library itself is complete; this
track only closes the proof obligation.

See [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) for the staged roadmap and
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the design
contract.

## Prerequisites

On a fresh machine you need four things before `lake build` will
work. The Lean toolchain and `just` itself aren't installed by
the project — they're external tools the recipes assume.

1. **`elan`** (Lean toolchain manager — provides `lake` /
   `lean`). The version in [`../../lean-toolchain`](../../lean-toolchain)
   is installed on first use.

   ```bash
   curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
   ```

2. **`just`** (task runner — every workflow below is wrapped in
   a `just` recipe; `just doctor` won't run until `just` itself
   is installed). Install via your platform's package manager
   (`brew install just`, `cargo install just`, distro package,
   …) — see <https://just.systems>.

3. **OpenSSL 3.x + `pkg-config`** (system-level build deps for
   the SHA-256 FFI shim — see [Dependencies → System-level](#system-level-build-time-native-deps)
   below for the per-platform one-liners).

4. **`python3` + `uv`** (only for `just official-ssz-vector-tests*`).
   Run `just setup-python` from the umbrella root once to create
   `.venv/` and install the harness deps.

From the umbrella root, verify everything in one shot:

```bash
just doctor          # checks elan/lake/lean + pkg-config/OpenSSL + python3/uv
```

## Dependencies

### Lean-level

* `LeanSha256` — sibling subpackage, pure-Lean SHA-256 reference
  (used by the kernel-reducible `Hasher.Sha256Spec` instance).
  Pulled in transitively via the umbrella's
  [`lake-manifest.json`](../../lake-manifest.json).

### System-level (build-time native deps)

The production `Hasher.Sha256` instance is an FFI shim
(`csrc/sha256_shim.c`) that links to **OpenSSL 3.x**. Lake
discovers the right link flags via `pkg-config --libs libcrypto`
at build time, so the same `lake build` works on Debian/Ubuntu
multiarch, Fedora `/usr/lib64`, Arch, Alpine, macOS Homebrew
(where `openssl@3` is keg-only), and NixOS store paths — pkg-
config does the platform discrimination for us. If `pkg-config`
itself isn't installed, the build falls back to the hardcoded
Debian-multiarch values, which keeps existing `apt`-only
environments working.

You need two system packages:

* **OpenSSL 3.x development files** — both the shared library
  (`libcrypto.so.3` / `libcrypto.3.dylib` / …) and the headers
  (`<openssl/evp.h>`).
* **`pkg-config`** — the canonical Unix discovery tool the build
  uses to find the above.

| Platform | One-liner |
|---|---|
| Debian / Ubuntu | `sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config` |
| Fedora / RHEL   | `sudo dnf install openssl-devel pkgconf-pkg-config` |
| Arch            | `sudo pacman -S openssl pkgconf` |
| Alpine          | `sudo apk add openssl-dev pkgconf` |
| macOS (Homebrew) | `brew install openssl@3 pkg-config` |
| NixOS           | add `openssl pkg-config` to your `shell.nix` / `flake.nix` |

To verify your machine is set up — both system deps and the Lean
toolchain — run from the umbrella root:

```bash
just doctor         # checks pkg-config + OpenSSL + elan/lake/lean + uv/python3
just doctor-native  # checks only pkg-config + OpenSSL (the CI gate)
```

`just doctor` prints actionable platform-specific install hints if
anything's missing. The CI `test` and `conformance` jobs run
`just doctor-native` as their first step.

### Why a procedural lakefile

The FFI shim build (`csrc/sha256_shim.c` + `csrc/sha256_batch.c`)
needs a `target … : FilePath := do …` step that the declarative
`lakefile.toml` syntax can't express. The procedural `lakefile.lean`
also hosts the `pkg-config` discovery (a `BaseIO` call at lakefile-
load time via `unsafeBaseIO`); both reasons keep this subpackage on
`lakefile.lean` even though the umbrella and the two sibling
subpackages stay on declarative TOML.

## Module overview

* `Spec/` — `SSZType` universe, `interp`, `serialize`,
  `deserialize`, `hashTreeRoot`. The verified core.
* `Repr/` — the `SSZRepr` typeclass + deriving handler.
* `Hasher/` — abstract `Hasher` typeclass; `Sha256` (FFI) +
  `Sha256Spec` (pure-Lean) instances; `Sha256Equiv` /
  `Sha256Batch` (the named equivalence axioms — see "Trust
  assumptions you can grep for" above).
* `Cache/` — both backends and the box layer that unifies them:
  * `Cache/TreeBacked.lean` — the **fast / cached** backend
    (`CachedSSZ H T`): production-side, FFI-hashed, O(log N)
    incremental updates.
  * `Cache/Uncached.lean` — the **pure / uncached** backend
    (`UncachedSSZ H T`): proof-side, no cache invariant, kernel-
    reducible when paired with `Sha256Spec`.
  * `Cache/Box.lean` — `SSZ.Box H T` closes the two backends
    into one user-facing sum type, and defines the four smart
    constructors (`SSZ.FastBox` / `SSZ.PureBox` /
    `SSZ.CachedBox` / `SSZ.UncachedBox`). Its module docstring
    documents the brand axes; start here for the user-facing
    surface.
  * `Cache/MerkleTree/` — the tree machinery the fast backend
    sits on; `Cache/Update.lean` is the `sszUpdate` macro.
* `Proofs/` — central proof artefacts and `@[ssz_simp]` set.
  The three central theorems (`decode_encode`,
  `serialize_injective`, `encode_size_le_max`) live in
  `Proofs/Roundtrip.lean`, `Proofs/Injective.lean`, and
  `Proofs/SizeBound.lean` respectively. All three are landed on
  the `SSZType.BasicSupported` cut (defined in
  `Spec/BasicSupported.lean`); the universally-quantified
  `Supported` form is open work — see
  [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) Phase 5.
* `Conformance/` — SSZ-library property-test gates (Sha256
  vectors, hasher equivalence, `setAt` randomised tests, cache
  machinery on example containers).

The CLI driver that runs the upstream consensus-spec-tests
corpus (`eth_ssz_vector_runner`) lives in the sibling
[`LeanEthCS`](../LeanEthCS) subpackage, driven by
`scripts/run_conformance.py` at the umbrella root. Use the
one-command `just official-ssz-vector-tests-all` entry point
documented in [Build / test](#build--test) to drive it.

## Build / test

```bash
just doctor                 # one-time sanity check on a fresh machine
lake build SizzLean         # compile the library
```

`just doctor` is the first thing to run on a new clone — it verifies
OpenSSL 3.x and `pkg-config` are present (the build-time native deps
the FFI shim links against, see [Dependencies](#dependencies)) plus
the Lean toolchain (elan / lake / lean) and the Python harness
toolchain (python3 / uv) used by the conformance recipes below. A
failed check prints the install command for your platform.

Three test surfaces, all driven from the umbrella `just` interface
at the repo root. The first two are quick; the third runs against
the downloaded upstream archive.

```bash
# SizzLean-internal property tests (Sha256 vectors, hasher
# equivalence, randomised setAt, cache coherence, sszUpdate cases —
# all fire as native_decide examples at build time)
just test-ssz

# Full NIST CAVP SHA-256 vectors — 129 byte-oriented cases
# (lives in the sibling LeanSha256 package, ~108s of native_decide)
just test-sha256

# Upstream `ethereum/consensus-spec-tests` — drives the Lean CLI
# against the official archives. A tqdm progress bar shows live
# per-case throughput. Quick sample:
just official-ssz-vector-tests
# Full `ssz_generic` sweep (~2188 in-scope cases, a couple of
# seconds — 292 progressive-container cases are out of scope):
just official-ssz-vector-tests-generic-full
# Full `ssz_static` sweep on mainnet preset (1585 cases, ~2 min):
just official-ssz-vector-tests-static-full
# Full `ssz_static` sweep on minimal preset (38991 cases, ~3 min):
just official-ssz-vector-tests-static-minimal
# Full upstream corpus: generic + static on both presets:
just official-ssz-vector-tests-all
```

For the full menu, the protocol the harness uses, and how to
write code that targets `SSZ.FastBox` (production cache) or
`SSZ.PureBox` (proof-friendly uncached) on a *single* spec body,
see [`MANUAL.md`](MANUAL.md).

## Requiring this package

`SizzLean` lives as a subpackage of the [`etheorem` umbrella
repository](https://github.com/etheorem/etheorem). To depend on it
from another Lake project, add a `[[require]]` block to your
`lakefile.toml`:

```toml
[[require]]
name = "SizzLean"
git = "https://github.com/etheorem/etheorem"
subDir = "packages/SizzLean"
rev = "main"  # pin to a specific commit hash for reproducible builds
```

Then run `lake update` to refresh `lake-manifest.json`. Per the
umbrella's [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) dependency policy, prefer
pinning `rev` to a specific commit hash over tracking a branch once
you've validated a working pair — branch-tracking turns every
upstream change into a silent dep bump.

SizzLean's only Lean-level dependency outside Lean core is the
sibling [`LeanSha256`](../LeanSha256) subpackage in the same umbrella;
adding the `[[require]]` above transitively pulls it in via the
umbrella's `lake-manifest.json`. The native build-time dependencies
(OpenSSL 3.x + `pkg-config`, used by the FFI SHA-256 shim) are listed
under [Dependencies](#dependencies); a stranger building from a clean
clone needs both the Lean-level `require` *and* those system packages.
