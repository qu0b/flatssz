# `SizzLean.Spec.Interp` — values inhabiting each SSZ shape

For each `SSZType` description, `SSZType.interp` returns the Lean
`Type` whose values are exactly the well-formed SSZ values of that
shape. This is the bridge between the syntactic universe in
`Spec/Type.lean` and the operations (`serialize`, `deserialize`,
`hashTreeRoot`) that consume real values.

Mirrors the consensus-specs *§SSZ Types* section. The unused SSZ
forms (`Union`, `ProgressiveContainer` / `StableContainer` / `Profile`
from EIP-7495, `ProgressiveList` / `ProgressiveBitlist` from EIP-7916,
`CompatibleUnion` from EIP-8016) are out-of-scope here — see the
docstring on `SizzLean.Spec.Type` for the rationale.

## Why a `mutual` block

A first attempt at `interp` (matching ARCHITECTURE.md §3.2's sketch)
defined the `container` case as `HList SSZType.interp fs` — a
heterogeneous list parameterised by `interp` itself. Lean 4.29.1's
structural-recursion checker rejects that form: passing the
recursive function as a higher-order argument hides the descent on
`fs`, and the equation compiler reports "unexpected occurrence of
recursive application". Well-founded recursion fares no better
because the obligation `sizeOf a < sizeOf (.container fs)` lacks the
membership hypothesis `a ∈ fs` that would make it provable.

The fix is to inline each list traversal as a mutually recursive
helper that consumes its list cons-by-cons. Each helper recurses
structurally on its list argument; `interp` calls the helpers on
subterms of its own argument (`fs` is a subterm of `.container fs`,
etc.). All four helpers are mutually structural-recursive, which the
checker accepts.

Semantically the result is the same heterogeneous tuple a user would
expect — `interp (.container [t₁, t₂]) = (t₁.interp × (t₂.interp × PUnit))`,
isomorphic to the `HList` formulation. The cost is one extra layer
of `Prod` nesting at the type level; the benefit is a structurally
recursive, total definition that downstream proofs can `simp`
through.

## Lean idioms used here, annotated on first appearance

* `{ x : α // p x }` — anonymous-subtype syntax: a pair of a value
  and a proof of `p x`, with the proof erased at runtime. Used to
  enforce capacity bounds on `list` and `bitlist`.
* `Vector α n` (Lean core ≥ 4.10) — length-indexed `Array`-backed
  structure with `xs[i]` indexing.
* `mutual … end` — declares a block of mutually recursive definitions
  whose calls between members are checked for joint termination.

/-- Map an SSZ description to the Lean type its values inhabit.

`uintN` widths beyond `{8,16,32,64}` fall back to `BitVec n` — this
keeps the function total without committing to a Lean representation
for the larger widths (`UInt128`/`UInt256` are not in core);
downstream code can pattern-match on the description if it wants
those native types when they ship. -/

/-! ## Spot-check: definitional equality across the four shape
families. Each `example : … := rfl` is a build-time assertion that
the two sides are definitionally equal — `rfl` is rejected by
elaboration otherwise. Type equality is propositional (not
`Decidable`) in Lean 4, so the `example := rfl` form is the
correct idiom here; CLAUDE.md explicitly lists it as the
load-bearing alternative to forbidden
`#eval` / `#check` / `#print`.

Under the hood, `rfl` here is `@rfl Type (SSZType.interp …)` — Lean
infers the universe (`Type 0` for all our shapes) and the LHS as the
expected term, then the kernel reduces `SSZType.interp` arm-by-arm
until both sides match. Failure to reduce manifests as an
"expected_type ≠ got_type" elaboration error, not a runtime panic. -/

example : SSZType.interp .bool             = Bool          := rfl
example : SSZType.interp (.uintN 64)       = UInt64        := rfl
example : SSZType.interp (.uintN 32)       = UInt32        := rfl
-- The fourth example exercises a *recursive* arm: `interp (.vector .bool 3)`
-- unfolds to `Vector (interp .bool) 3` which further unfolds to
-- `Vector Bool 3`. The kernel performs both reductions to close `rfl`.
