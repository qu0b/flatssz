# `SizzLean.Cache.TreeBacked` — the **fast (cached) backend**

This file is the home of `CachedSSZ H T` — the **fast** branch
of the two-backend story documented in `Cache/Box.lean`. The
companion **pure (uncached)** backend lives in
`Cache/Uncached.lean`; `Cache/Box.lean`'s `SSZ.Box` sum closes
the two together and defines the four user-facing smart
constructors (`SSZ.FastBox` / `SSZ.PureBox` and the
hasher-explicit `SSZ.CachedBox` / `SSZ.UncachedBox`). Start with
`Cache/Box.lean`'s module docstring for the brand framing.

ARCHITECTURE.md §6.3. The user-facing pairing of a Lean value
`view : T` with a `Node`-shaped Merkle backing
`tree : Node`. The smart constructor `TreeBacked.ofValue` builds the
tree from a value; `hashTreeRootCached` returns the cached root in
constant time on a fully-cached tree.

## Coherence invariant

`hashTreeRootCached t = SSZ.hashTreeRoot t.view` for every
`t : TreeBacked H T`. This is *maintained by the smart constructors*,
not encoded as a Lean proposition — the value/tree coupling can
diverge under a hand-rolled `TreeBacked.mk` without it being a
type error. Smart constructors plus the acceptance property test
(`Conformance/TreeBackedCoherence.lean`) are the discipline.

## Hasher pinning + parameter order

`TreeBacked H T` carries the hasher `H` in the *type*: the tree was
built with `H`'s `combine` operation, and every subsequent update
must use the same `H` or the cache slots go out of sync with the
spec's root. Encoding `H` in the type makes wrong-hasher use a
type error rather than a silent root mismatch — the user picks `H`
once at `ofValue` time, and downstream `sszUpdate` /
`hashTreeRootCached` calls infer it from the value's type.

The hasher `H` comes *first* in the parameter order so a
particular `H` can be partially applied to yield a single-arg type
constructor: `abbrev Sha256Cached (T : Type) [SSZRepr T] :=
TreeBacked Sha256 T` becomes the natural shortcut for the common
case of fixing one hasher across many content types.

## How the tree is built

`ofValue` delegates to `Node.ofShape` (in `MerkleTree/Build.lean`),
which walks the SSZ shape from `r.shape` and the value's
`SSZType.interp r.shape` projection, producing a `Node` whose
interior structure mirrors the SSZ shape:

* Container fields → balanced sub-trees with one leaf (or sub-tree)
  per field.
* Composite-element vectors / lists → balanced sub-trees with one
  sub-tree per element.
* Basic-element vectors / bitvectors → chunk-packed bytes as
  leaves, exactly matching the spec's `merkleize` shape.
* `bitlist` / `list` → wrap the body sub-tree with a
  `mix-in-length` sibling.

Each interior `pair` starts with `cache = none`; the first call to
`merkleRootWithCache` fills every cache slot on its walk. Subsequent
field-mutation operations invalidate only the spine, leaving
off-path cached roots intact — this is the cache layer earning
its name.

## When the cache short-circuits

After one full root walk, the entire tree is cached. A subsequent
`hashTreeRootCached` returns in O(1) (one `.leaf` / `.pair` cache
read). After a single field mutation, `merkleRootWithCache` walks
only the dirty spine — O(depth) hashes — because every off-path
`pair` still carries its cached root.

## Pending-overlay — deferred tree-side writes

Each `TreeBacked` carries a third field — `pending : Std.TreeMap
Nat Node` — that accumulates tree-side writes from `sszUpdate`
without immediately walking the spine. The `view` side stays
eager: every `sszUpdate` write the user types is reflected in
`view` *immediately* and is observable by `t.view.f` reads.
Only the *tree* side defers — the actual `Node.setManyAt` spine
walk runs on demand inside `commit`, which every root reader
(`hashTreeRootCached`, `serialize`, …) calls automatically
before consulting the cache.

The win is cross-statement batching: a chain
`let s := sszUpdate s with x := 1`, `let s := sszUpdate s with
y := 2`, `let s := sszUpdate s with z := 3`, then
`s.hashTreeRootCached` produces *one* `setManyAt` walk at the
read, not three. The three writes accumulate in `pending` and
are replayed in gindex-ascending order at commit, feeding
`setManyAt`'s partition-by-first-bit step efficient runs.

`treeBase` is the field documented as *pre-commit*; library
code that needs the up-to-date tree shape (root walk,
serialisation, etc.) goes through `committedTree` so the pending
map is always applied first. The two-state shape is named:

* `view`     — always current (eager view-side update).
* `treeBase` — the tree before pending is replayed.
* `pending`  — gindex → replacement subtree, accumulated since
              the last `commit`.

## File placement

This file lives under `SizzLean/Cache/` alongside its sibling
`Cache/Uncached.lean`. The two are parallel implementations of the
cache abstraction: `TreeBacked` is the Merkle-cached production
flavour; `UncachedSSZ` is the pure-Lean proof-friendly flavour.
The shared `SSZCaching` class lives in `Cache/Class.lean`, and the
`sszUpdate t with …` syntax (`Cache/Update.lean`) elaborates to a
per-flavour optimal emission. -/

/-- A pending tree-side write: a closure that, at commit time,
extracts the relevant sub-value from the **current** `view : T`
and builds the matching sub-tree via `Node.ofShape`. Returns
`Option Node` so the closure can signal `none` for writes that
ended up as no-ops on the view side (e.g. an `xs[i] := v`
whose `i` is out-of-bounds — `Array.set!` silently leaves the
array unchanged, and the cache must mirror that decision).

Reading the value from `view` at commit (rather than capturing
it at insert time) is what makes overlapping parent/child writes
mutually consistent. Two `sszUpdate` statements with a strict-
prefix gindex relation both leave entries in `pending`; at
commit, each entry's closure projects the latest sub-value out
of `view`, so the parent's sub-tree already incorporates every
later child override and vice-versa. The downstream
`commitAndHash` rule that drops a non-empty-path entry when an
ancestor (`[]`-path) entry is at the same level then becomes a
correct optimisation, because the ancestor's sub-tree is built
from a `view` that already reflects the child write.

The `Option` return also handles **stale index entries** when a
later write shrinks the surrounding list. The macro-emitted
closure walks the same projection path the user wrote; for any
index step `xs[i]`, it emits a bounds check (`i < xs.size`) and
returns `none` when the index is OOB. Combined with the
`view`-side `Array.set!` no-op semantics, this keeps the cache
in lockstep with the view regardless of the element type's
`Inhabited` default.

Parameterised by the container type `T` of the owning
`TreeBacked`. The closure's input has type `T`; the output is
`Option Node`. -/
def PendingWrite (T : Type) : Type := T → Option Node

/-- A value `view` paired with a `Node`-shaped Merkle backing
`treeBase`, plus a deferred-write overlay (`pending`) that
batches `sszUpdate`s between root reads. Parameterised by the
hasher `H` that produced any cache slots in `treeBase`; pinning
`H` in the type prevents combining caches built with different
hashers. The coupling between `view`, `treeBase`, and `pending`
is maintained by smart constructors — not by a Lean-level
invariant proof.

The deferred overlay is what makes the cache layer faster than
eager-tree designs: by collecting writes into `pending` first,
the eventual `hashTreeRoot` walk does *one* `setManyAt` that
shares spine allocations across all writes, instead of N
independent walks per write. Overwritten writes (where
`TreeMap.insert` replaces an entry at the same gindex) save
their `Node.ofShape` cost entirely — the dropped `PendingWrite`
closure goes to GC without ever running. -/

exactly `TreeBacked H T` (an `abbrev`, so the two are definitionally
equal and either name accepts the other), but it reads as a
value-level abstraction — *"a cached SSZ value"* — without
committing the reader to the Merkle-tree mechanism that underpins
the cache.

Library code that talks about the cache mechanism (cache slots,
gindex paths, `Node.setManyAt`) uses `TreeBacked`; library code
exposed to users prefers `CachedSSZ`. Both live in

This is the *single* tree-walk for the whole batch — the cross-

elaborator (in `Cache/Update.lean`) routes through them on the
cached path.

  `2 ^ chunkDepth(N) + k`, container with N fields, field index k.
* `setAtBits  t bits newSub newView` — pre-composed path bits for
  nested updates (e.g. vector position inside a container field).

/-! ### `CachedSSZ` namespace — user-facing aliases

`CachedSSZ` is an `abbrev` for `TreeBacked`, so dot notation
(`s.tree`, `s.view`) and instance lookup already see through it.
Lean's namespace resolution, however, does *not* follow the
abbrev when looking up `CachedSSZ.ofValue` — you'd land in
`TreeBacked.ofValue` only by typing `TreeBacked` directly. The
two short aliases below restore the symmetry with
`UncachedSSZ.ofValue` / `UncachedSSZ.hashTreeRoot` so one-flavour
user code never has to mention `TreeBacked` (the internal name)
or the legacy `hashTreeRootCached` suffix. -/

/-- Build a `CachedSSZ H T` from a plain `T`. Alias of
`TreeBacked.ofValue` exposed on the user-facing namespace. -/

/-- Cached Merkle root of `s`. Same as `TreeBacked.hashTreeRootCached`;
the alias drops the `Cached` suffix so the call mirrors
`UncachedSSZ.hashTreeRoot` and the dot-notation `s.hashTreeRoot`
reads identically across both flavours. -/
