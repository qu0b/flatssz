# `SizzLean.Cache.MerkleTree.Zero` — the zero-hash tower and the depth-padding leaf

A 65-entry table of all-zero subtree roots, used both to
short-circuit zero-padding in `merkleRootWithCache` and to
materialise `zeroLeaf d` (the right-sibling subtree at any
depth when `setAt` walks past a not-yet-filled position).

The table is **memoised once at module load** into a private
`IO.Ref`, populated by direct calls to `SizzLean.Hasher.sha256Combine`
(the FFI primitive — no `Hasher.combine` typeclass dispatch). The
public accessor `zeroHashAt` reads from the memo via `unsafeBaseIO`;
the ref is set-once-at-init and never mutated after, so the access is
morally const. The polymorphic `[Hasher H]` parameter on `zeroHashAt`
remains as a vestigial signature compatibility marker so callers
(`zeroLeaf`, `Node.ofLeaves`, …) don't need to change — by the
`sha256Combine_eq_spec` axiom the bytes returned would be identical
regardless of which hasher's combine the caller's `[Hasher H]`
refers to.

## Reduction at module-load time

The recurrence
    `Z[0] = zero32`
    `Z[d+1] = sha256Combine Z[d] Z[d]`
is structural recursion on `Nat`. Each level is computed once at
module load via the FFI `lean_ssz_sha256_combine` shim; subsequent
`zeroHashAt _ d` calls are O(1) Vector indexes into the memo.

`Vector.get` with a `Fin 65` index is total; the `zeroHashAt`
fallback (`d ≥ 65`) is defensive — SSZ's `MAX_LENGTH = 2^32` keeps
any real tree depth well under 65 — but cheap to include and
required for `ofLeaves` / `setAt` to typecheck without local bound
proofs at every call site.

## Trust footprint

The `unsafeBaseIO` accessor for the memo adds one implementation-
defined trust assumption: the `initialize` block runs before any
reader. This is parallel to (and same trust class as) the existing
`@[extern] opaque sha256Combine` declaration; both are validated
by the `Sha256Equivalence` test suite re-running the recurrence
against the pure-Lean reference.

/-- 32-byte all-zero `ByteArray`. The leaf at every depth-`0`
position of an all-zero subtree. Identical to `Spec.zero32` — kept
here as a small private duplicate rather than importing the
spec-internal helper because the Tree layer is meant to stand
alone (so a future caller could load it without the spec). -/
private def zero32 : ByteArray :=
  let rec build : Nat → ByteArray → ByteArray
    | 0,     acc => acc
    | k + 1, acc => build k (acc.push 0)
  build 32 ByteArray.empty

/-- Pure recurrence for the depth-`d` Sha256 zero-hash. Used only
at module-load time to populate the memoised table — no runtime
callers. Calls `SizzLean.Hasher.sha256Combine` (the FFI primitive)
directly rather than going through `Hasher.combine`'s typeclass
dispatch, since the memo is intentionally Sha256-specific. -/
private def zeroHashRec : Nat → ByteArray
  | 0     => zero32
  | d + 1 =>
      let z : ByteArray := zeroHashRec d
      sha256Combine z z

/-- The depth-indexed zero-hash table, lazily populated at module
load. Held inside an `IO.Ref` so the 65-entry vector is computed
exactly once per process; readers go through `zeroHashes` (and
ultimately `zeroHashAt`) which fetch in O(1). -/
private initialize zeroHashesRef : IO.Ref (Vector ByteArray 65) ←
  IO.mkRef (Vector.ofFn (fun (i : Fin 65) => zeroHashRec i.val))

/-- Runtime impl of `zeroHashes`: reads the memoised vector
directly from `zeroHashesRef`. Wrapped in `unsafeBaseIO` because
the ref is set-once at init and never mutated, so the value is
morally const. Marked `unsafe` so the compiler accepts the
`unsafeBaseIO` call; the safe `zeroHashes` def below swaps to
this impl via `@[implemented_by]`. -/
private unsafe def zeroHashesUnsafeImpl : Vector ByteArray 65 :=
  unsafeBaseIO zeroHashesRef.get

/-- Safe public-facing zero-hash table. The kernel-visible body
is the pure recurrence (slow, would re-run on every reduction);
the runtime body — substituted via `@[implemented_by]` — is the
`unsafeBaseIO`-backed read from the memoised ref. Both produce
identical bytes by construction (the ref was populated by the
same `zeroHashRec` recurrence at module load), so the trust
footprint of the swap is "the init action ran before any
reader" — same trust class as the `@[extern] opaque sha256Combine`
that populated the ref. -/
@[implemented_by zeroHashesUnsafeImpl]
private def zeroHashes : Vector ByteArray 65 :=
  Vector.ofFn (fun (i : Fin 65) => zeroHashRec i.val)

/-- Zero-hash at depth `d`: the root of an all-zero subtree of
depth `d`. Real trees never hit the `d ≥ 65` fallback (SSZ
`MAX_LENGTH = 2^32` keeps any real tree depth well under 65); the
fallback is a totality convenience for callers without a local
bound proof on `d`.

The `[Hasher H]` parameter is vestigial — the memoised table is
Sha256-specific and read directly, but by the
`sha256Combine_eq_spec` axiom the bytes are identical to what any
equivalent hasher's recurrence would compute. Keeping the
parameter preserves the existing call-site signatures
(`zeroLeaf H d`, `Node.ofLeaves H leaves depth`, …) without
cascading edits. -/
def zeroHashAt (H : Type) [Hasher H] (d : Nat) : ByteArray :=
  if h : d < 65 then zeroHashes.get ⟨d, h⟩ else zero32

/-- Cheap root lookup that *doesn't* allocate a new cache-filled
tree. `.leaf b` → `b`; `.pair _ _ (some r)` → `r` in O(1);
`.pair _ _ none` → recursively walks the children. Used by
builders that need a child's root to embed into a parent's cache
slot at construction time.

Not a substitute for `merkleRootWithCache` — it doesn't fill
cache slots in the input tree. Use when you only need the root
*value* and the input is expected to be already cached (in which
case it's O(1)). -/

/-- A `Node` whose root is the all-zero subtree of depth `d`. Used
by `Node.ofLeaves` to pad the right of an underfilled tree, and by
`Node.setAt` when walking past a not-yet-filled position.

For `d = 0` this is a literal zero leaf; for `d > 0` it is a
`pair` whose cache slot is pre-filled with `zeroHashAt H (d+1)` —
this lets `merkleRootWithCache` short-circuit the entire zero
subtree on the first walk without re-hashing. -/
def zeroLeaf (H : Type) [Hasher H] : Nat → Node
  | 0     => .leaf zero32
  | d + 1 =>
      let child := zeroLeaf H d
      let r := zeroHashAt H (d + 1)
      .pair child child (some r)

/-- Build a balanced binary tree of depth `depth`, taking
`leaves` as the left-aligned data leaves and padding the right
with `zeroLeaf` subtrees as necessary. The result is the `Node`
whose `merkleRootWithCache` matches the spec's `merkleize` of
the same leaf list at the same depth.

Termination: structural recursion on `depth`. -/

  | d + 1, ls      =>
      -- Split `ls` at index `2^d`. The left half goes into the
      -- left subtree (size `2^d`); whatever remains feeds the
      -- right subtree. We compute the parent's root inline and
      -- store it in the cache slot — this avoids a subsequent

      -- with the cache filled in.
