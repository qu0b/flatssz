# `SizzLean.Cache.MerkleTree.SetAt` — generalized-index updates

The highest-risk file in the project per the Nimbus February
2025 incident — an off-by-one in gindex arithmetic caused a
mainnet client to fork. The mitigation here: never do gindex
arithmetic on `Nat`. Instead, extract the path as a `List Bool`
*once* and recurse structurally on the bit list. The compiler
enforces exhaustiveness; the bit-list shape makes left/right
confusion syntactically impossible at the call site.

## Gindex path convention

A *generalized index* `g : Nat` identifies one node in a binary
tree, 1-indexed from the root:

| gindex | binary | path |
|--------|--------|------|
| 1      | `1`    | root            (path: `[]`) |
| 2      | `10`   | left of root    (path: `[false]`) |
| 3      | `11`   | right of root   (path: `[true]`) |
| 4      | `100`  | left-left       (path: `[false, false]`) |
| 5      | `101`  | left-right      (path: `[false, true]`) |
| 6      | `110`  | right-left      (path: `[true, false]`) |
| 7      | `111`  | right-right     (path: `[true, true]`) |

The leading `1` bit is the *root marker*; remaining bits MSB-first
spell the path. `false` = take the left child, `true` = take the
right child.

`gindexBits` returns exactly those path bits, in order from root to
target. The implementation uses `Nat.log2` and `Nat.testBit` —
no division-by-2 ad-hoc, no fuel arguments — so the result is a
direct read of the existing well-tested integer primitives.

/-- Path bits for a generalized index, root-to-target order
(`false` = left, `true` = right). The leading `1` bit of `g`'s binary
representation is *not* included.

Reads bits MSB-first from position `g.log2 - 1` down to `0`. For
`g = 1`, `log2 = 0`, range is empty → `[]`. For `g = 2`, `log2 = 1`,
range `[0]` reversed → `[0]`, `testBit 2 0 = false` → `[false]`. -/

  let n := g.log2
  (List.range n).reverse.map (fun i => g.testBit i)

example : gindexBits 1 = []                       := rfl
example : gindexBits 2 = [false]                  := rfl
example : gindexBits 3 = [true]                   := rfl

example : gindexBits 7 = [true,  true]            := rfl
example : gindexBits 8 = [false, false, false]    := rfl

/-- Replace the subtree at the path described by `bits` with
`newSubtree`. Recursion is *structural on the bit list* — this is
the mitigation for the Nimbus-class gindex arithmetic bug. The
`pair`'s cache slot is cleared on the spine (set to `none`); off-path
children are reused by value, so reference-counting gives the
structural sharing for free.

* `[]` — we've reached the target, replace.
* `false :: rest` — descend left, rebuild `pair` with cleared cache.
* `true :: rest` — descend right, rebuild `pair` with cleared cache.

`leaf` with a non-empty bit list means the gindex addresses a
position deeper than the tree extends. Returning the leaf unchanged
is the most conservative response — real use shouldn't hit this. -/

/-! ## Batched updates — `Node.setManyAt`

`setManyAt n [(bits₁, v₁), …, (bitsₖ, vₖ)]` applies all `k` writes in
a single tree walk. When several writes share a path prefix, only
*one* fresh `.pair` is allocated at each level of the shared spine —
contrast the chained form `((n.setAtBits bits₁ v₁).setAtBits bits₂
v₂).setAtBits …`, which allocates one full spine per write and
clears the cache on every off-target sibling along the way.

### What an empty path means at each level

Path bits are *consumed* as we descend: a write `(b :: rest, v)` at
a pair contributes `(rest, v)` to the matching child's recursion.
By the time the recursion reaches the targeted node, the path is
`[]` — that's the "you're here" signal, exactly like
`Node.setAtBits _ [] v = v`.

At both leaves *and* pairs, an `[]`-path update replaces the entire
current subtree with the update's value. If multiple `[]`-path
updates are present at the same level, the *last* one wins (matching
`setAtBits`'s left-to-right replacement semantics). Non-empty-path
updates at a leaf are silently dropped (the path extends past where
the tree exists — same conservative response as `setAtBits`'s
`.leaf b, _ :: _ => .leaf b` arm).

### Precondition: no path is a strict prefix of another

`setManyAt` does *not* try to apply non-empty-path updates after a
whole-subtree replacement at the same level. If the caller passes
both `([], v)` and `(someBits, w)` at the same level (e.g.
`sszUpdate t with message := …, message.slot := …` — the second
clause is `message`'s child), the `setManyAt` result honours the
whole-subtree replacement and silently drops the deeper write. The
`sszUpdate` macro doesn't generate such mixes in practice; the
nested-vs-flat clauses it produces always target disjoint paths
(no one path is a prefix of another).

### Algorithm

* `n, []`: nothing to do.
* `.leaf b, us`: fold over `us`. Each `([], v)` entry replaces the
  current leaf with `v` (last wins).
* `.pair l r _, us`: first pull out the last `[]`-path update as
  `wholeReplacement?`; if present, return its value (with the
  precondition above). Otherwise partition the non-empty-path
  updates by first bit and descend on each side. Reuse a side by
  value when it has no updates — that's the cache-preservation
  property.

Termination: structural recursion on `Node` (we always descend into
`l` and `r` from the `.pair` arm). The `us` argument is processed
by `filterMap`/`foldl`, not pattern-matched into shorter forms —
the size guarantee comes from the `Node` argument alone.

/-! ## Fused commit + root walk — `Node.commitAndHash`

`setManyAt` followed by `merkleRootWithCache` walks the touched
spine *twice*: once to install the new sub-trees (allocating
`.pair _ _ none` cells along the way), once to fill the cache
slots (allocating `.pair _ _ (some r)` for the same cells).
`commitAndHash` fuses both into one walk — each touched spine cell
is allocated once, with its root computed inline.

For untouched branches, returns the existing child by reference
(zero allocation) and reads its root via `Node.rootOf` (O(1) when
cached, recursive otherwise). New sub-trees supplied via `updates`
should ideally come pre-cached (e.g. from the post-modification
`Node.ofShape` builders that now embed cache slots) so the
recursive `rootOf` on them is O(1) at the top.

The result is observationally equivalent to
`(n.setManyAt updates).merkleRootWithCache H`, just allocated
half as many spine pairs. -/
